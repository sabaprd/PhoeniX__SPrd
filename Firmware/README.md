Firmware
============

<div align="justify">

We have developed an automated software process and simulation for the phoeniX processor, specifically designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible on Linux systems. To simplify the simulation process, we have included a Makefile in the main repository directory, which eliminates the need for a complex RISC-V GCC Toolchain flow and terminal commands. 
Our Makefile offers enhanced functionality, allowing both C and assembly codes to be executed using the original RISC-V compiler and assembler. This flexibility provides developers with greater options when working with the phoeniX processor.

The Makefile relies on essential scripts located in the `Firmware` directory, which should not be removed. Firmware dicrectory contains:
- `start.s` : Assembly code for registers initialization and stack setup
- `start.ld` : Linker script for `start.s` file
- `riscv.ld` : Linker script for RISC-V 32-bit architecture responsible for organizing the different sections of an executable in memory
- `syscall.c` : C code implementing a minimalistic set of system calls and related functions
- `hex_converter.py` : Python script to generate a Verilog standard hex file representing the instruction memory

However, users can customize these scripts to suit their specific application requirements if needed, while still ensuring the Makefile's integrity and functionality.
